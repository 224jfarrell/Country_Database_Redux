## Reporting a Vulnerability

Use this section to tell people how to report a vulnerability.

Tell them where to go, how often they can expect to get an update on a
reported vulnerability, what to expect if the vulnerability is accepted or
declined, etc.

Report issues in the issue tab. If the vulnerability is relevant to the project, I will work on fixing it as soon as possible. An update can be expected hopefully within a week but I cannot be certain.
